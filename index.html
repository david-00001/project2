  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>In 2020 the US along with the rest of the world experienced a tremendous upset in lifestyle that reached virtually every person. 
    Daily news updates communicated the spread of COVID as well as the responses from state governments. Several websites including the 
    CDC produced real-time information to help people understand the spread of this new pandemic.
  </p>
  <p>This dashboard was created in fulfillment of a class project to create a dashboard that makes use of JavaScript, Flask, D3, and other utilities learned.</p>
  <p>Our objective was to create a dashboard that allowed a user to explore the spread of COVID in the US both geographically and by race/ethnicity.</p>
  <h3>Data Sources</h3>
  <p>Data for the charts on the Cases page as well as the US Map is obtained from <a href="https://api.covidtracking.com/">https://api.covidtracking.com/</a></p>
  <p>Data for the Race/Ethnicity page is obtained from ___________________________. The data was prepared for use via a python flask app 
    and therefore is dependent on launching the flask app before the page will display correctly.</p>
